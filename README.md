# Linear Algebra

## Introduction

I am a self-taught individual, which means I have learned linear algebra independently.

In linear algebra, a matrix is defined by a letter, and the dimensions of the matrix are indicated below the letter. For example, *A*₃ₓ₂ means the matrix has 3 rows and 2 columns. Each position in the matrix is defined by its row and column.

**Example**

*A* =

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  a₁₁ & a₁₂ & \dots & a₁ₙ  \\
  a₂₁ & a₂₂ & \dots & a₂ₙ  \\
  aₙ₁ & aₙ₂ & \dots & aₙₙ 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

We have the first position, which is **a₁₁**. This means **a₁₁** is in the **first row and first column**.

More practice example:

*B* =

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 2  \\
  3 & 4  \\
  5 & 6 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The position of 5 is in the 3rd row, 1st column.  
The position of 2 is in the 1st row, 2nd column.

When a matrix has only 1 row, it is called a **Column Vector**.

*C* =

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  a₁ \\
  a₂ \\
  aₙ
\end{pmatrix}
$$
